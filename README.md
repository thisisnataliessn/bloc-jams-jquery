# jQuery music player

This music player was a project used for practicing jQuery. The starter code came from 
[here](https://github.com/Bloc/bloc-jams-jquery-starter). I added a few JS files to make
the user intaction function as expected (e.g. hover states for the song list, play/pause/
next/skip button functionality, volume/time controls, etc.).

You can test the player [here](https://basicmusicplayer.netlify.com/).
